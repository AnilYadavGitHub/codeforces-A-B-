Input The first line contains one integer t  (1≤t≤100 ) — the number of test cases.  Each test case consists of one line containing an expression of the form a+b  (0≤a,b≤9 , both a  and b  are integers). The integers are not separated from the +  sign.  Output For each test case, print one integer — the result of the expression.
